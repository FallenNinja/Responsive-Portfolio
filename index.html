            <p>Hello world. my name is Edwin Martinez. I don't like to speak about myself much... Since I have to I can start talking about my insterests and aspirations.
                My interests in life has always been video games. I've always been interested in all aspects, how to beat them, and how they function and how they are made. 
                I've always worked manual and hard working labor, I am interested in going away from that. My final goal is to become a big wig programmer, web design and
                programming is only the beggining.
